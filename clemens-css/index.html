        <h2>Homework Instructions</h2>
        <p>First, on Github, you must fork to your profile. Then clone your forked version to your computer. After that, the next step is to create your folder within the name: lastname-css, where "lastname" is your last name.</p>
        <p>Inside your specific folder, create an index.html file. Then, create an assests folder. Inside the assests folder, create a css folder. Inside css, create a style file. Once you've completed your practice site, follow the procedure: push the changes
          to your forked code repo, then create a pull request to the org.</p>

      <h2>Coding Sucks</h2>
      <p><img src="piggy.png" alt="pig" id="box3pig">Coding is not very fun for me. Next time, could we maybe just draw the website. That would be more fun. Although, my picture of the pig has really elevated this assignment, in my opinion. Therefore, you
        should give me an A.</p>
      <h2>Yup, Coding Sucks</h2>
      <p><img src="piggy.png" alt="pig" id="box3pig">Coding takes a very long time, especially if you don't really know what you're doing. Google has proved to be a useful tool.</p>
